## Overview

Sick-Fits is a simple ecommerce site used to help me learn TypeScript on the backend, Next.js, and GraphQL.

With the TypeScript I was able to further reduce any bugs that might come into play when creating a backend database with APIs.

Keystone is a great UI for the backend side of things allowing users to add things through a simple page rather then needing to navigate the site if they choose to do so.
